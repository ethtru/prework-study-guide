# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description 

This is a webpage that was built as a reference guide to store important notes on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git so that I can be successful in bootcamp. This will keep an organized list of information that can be added to and referenced as I learn more on my bootcamp journey. I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and git flow while constructing this webpage.
